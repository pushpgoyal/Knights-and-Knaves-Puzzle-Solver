This project is a Python solver for classic Knights and Knaves puzzles. In these puzzles, characters are either knights, who always tell the truth, or knaves, who always lie. The program uses symbolic logic to represent each character's status (for example, "A is a Knight" and "A is a Knave") and builds logical statements based on the characters' claims.

Here's a quick overview of how it works:

Symbolic Representation:
Each character has two symbols—one for being a knight and one for being a knave. This helps the program set up the basic rules (a character can't be both at the same time).

Knowledge Base:
The project creates logical sentences for different puzzles using operators like And, Or, Not, and Implication. These sentences capture the clues given by the characters' statements.

Model Checking:
The solver uses a model-checking function to test which symbols (or character identities) are true based on the logical constraints.

Puzzle Solutions:
For each puzzle, the program prints the determined identity of the characters. For example, if a character's statement forces them to be a knight, that result is shown in the output.

Overall, the project demonstrates how logical reasoning and programming can work together to solve puzzles. It’s both an educational tool and an interesting challenge for anyone curious about logic puzzles and AI.

# Knights-and-Knaves-Puzzle-Solver
A Python project that solves classic Knights and Knaves puzzles using logical inference. Characters in these puzzles are either knights, who always tell the truth, or knaves, who always lie. The project uses a symbolic logic approach to determine each characterâ€™s identity based on their statements.
